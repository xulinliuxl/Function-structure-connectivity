# Function-structure-connectivity
Analyses are performed in MATLAB

Contains code on
1) Create functional connectivity from rs-fMRI and structural connectivity from DTI using nodes defined by the Brainnetome atlas

2) Multivariate analysis of functional connectivity from rs-fMRI and structural connectivity from DTI
Can choose between canonical correlation analysis (CCA) or partial least squares (PLS)

3) Extract the function-structure converging connectivity and function-structure diverging connectivity and how to map onto cortical networks as defined by Yeo et al 2011 J Neurophysiol as well as a set of subcortical regions including the amygdala, hippocampus, basal ganglia and thalamus.
